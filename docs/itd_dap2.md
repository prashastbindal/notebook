### Retrospective
In the last iteration we implemented a simple CRUD web app that allows users to upload and view pdfs of notes for different classes. We were successfully able to accomplish all of our tasks and deliver everything we set out to do for Iteration 1. One of the reasons things went well this iteration was that we were all familiar with the architecture and tools we used because we went over them in lecture. There were a few things we can improve on, however. During the first iteration, it was difficult to divide work equally without a working application since certain foundational tasks were more time consuming than others. Moving forward, it should be easier to modularize work so that everyone has something different to work on now that our app is up and running and we have more tasks to work on. Moreover, we could also try to estimate the development time for each task that we take up and be more specific about what needs to be done in order to improve how we divide up work.
