### Retrospective
In this iteration we added many additional features to our application, such as commenting functionality, automatic testing, and searching and sorting of courses and notes. In addition, we worked on styling the app to make it look and feel better. Finally, we did a lot of bug-fixing and refactoring work behind the scenes to improve our app and make our lives easier in the future. Generally, this was a successful iteration, as we completed the tasks we set out for ourselves. However, due to the chaos of spring break and the global COVID-19 pandemic, we often failed to hold each other accountable for the work we needed to do or prioritize this class over other concerns. On the bright side, we had success splitting the work for this iteration up into manageable tasks for each team member as the work we have to do has opened up a lot since iteration 1. We expect to have the same success for iteration 3.
