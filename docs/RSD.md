Problem Statement
Taking notes in class is important for students so that they have an accurate and complete record of the material covered. Some students like taking their own notes as they find it helps them remember the content, but for others trying to write down everything that the professor says and writes can be difficult or distracting and detrimental to their ability to comprehend the material. Note-sharing between students is a natural way to solve this problem, but asking other students for notes individually can be difficult. An online platform where students can share their notes without individual requests would benefit many students, both those that don't want to take notes and those that do. Students that will take notes anyway would benefit from this arrangement because they would get access to other students' notes which may be better or more complete in some areas, and their notes would be checked by other students. They could also benefit from the collaboration this platform would have the potential to create. The platform could enable students to collaboratively take notes in real-time, enabling the class to take more complete and accurate notes with less individual effort from each of the students. This would also make it useful for creating study guides for exams.

Potential Clients
All students would be potential clients as everyone stands to gain from course notes and study guides being shared.
It could also be useful for TAs to read up on what material is being covered and for professors to gauge students' understanding of the material.

Proposed Solution
A web app would allow students to upload different types of files and allow other students in the course to view these materials. It would also enable students to upvote notes or make comments. The app could have its own collaborative note editor as well, which would function similar to how Google Docs work, allowing multiple students to edit in real-time.

Must have
As a student I want to add a course so I can upload and view notes for it
As a student I want to upload my notes so I can share them with others
As a student I want to browse the available notes for a course so I can find good notes

As a student I want to upvote notes that I think are useful so other students will find them
As a student I want to comment on or suggest changes to a note
As an admin I want to remove posts that are inappropriate or not relevant to the course

Nice to have
As a student I want to create notes collaboratively with others
As a student I want to be able to highlight sections of notes (typed and handwritten) that are important so I and others can easily find the information
As a student I want to be able to search all notes for a course for mentions of specific topics so I can easily find information
As a student I want to be able to edit notes in Markdown or LaTeX
As a student I want to be able to draw diagrams in the note editor
As a student I want there to be text recognition so I can search inside of handwritten notes

Software Architecture
It will be a web app as it is mostly intended for use on laptops but should be accessible across all platforms. It will conform to the client-server architecture.
