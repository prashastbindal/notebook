### Iteration Backlog
* As a student I want to be able to search all notes for a course for mentions of specific topics so I can easily find information.
* As a student I want to be able to sort notes using additional criteria such as date, popularity, rating, etc.
* As a student I want to upvote notes that I think are useful so other students will find them.

### Tasks
* Extend searching to include text inside of text notes, not just title.
* Implement some sort of OCR to allow users to perform the aforementioned searches on uploaded PDFs.
* Extend sorting to allow sorting by metadata (upvotes, date, ...) that shows up in additional columns like in a filesystem.
* Add the ability to upvote a note.
* Style note view, increase pdf viewer size/zoom, and style comments.
* Add simple user functionality to app via cookies.
