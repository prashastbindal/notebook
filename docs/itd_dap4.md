### Iteration Backlog
Note that both of these stories are in the "Nice to have" section of our RSD. We're still doing a lot of work on our "Must have" stories in this iteration, but most of them are already technically done, they just need polishing. See our Tasks list for details.
* As a student I want to be able to edit notes in Markdown or LaTeX.
* As a student I want there to be text recognition so I can search inside of handwritten notes.

### Tasks
* Modify the note text submission area to accept Markdown and LaTeX.
* Actually implement log-in system.
* Integrate Google log-in
* Make the notes sidebar collapsable.
* Style the comments hierarchically.
* Add "search by" filters for notes.
* Pop-up the signin page instead of redirecting the user when they try to add a comment or note without logging in.
* Improve OCR for handwritten notes.
* Make the app reactive for mobile devices.
